# VRAIDS
•	Virtual Reality Assisted Interior Design System (VRAIDS) updates the display of the screen dynamically according to user’s head position, creating the illusion of 3 dimensional virtual space. By also tracking the movement of hands, the system allows user to interact with virtual objects (add, delete and move) within the space by gestures.
