# VRAIDS
Virtual Reality Assisted Interior Design System (VRAIDS) updates the display of the screen dynamically according to user’s head position, creating the illusion of 3 dimensional virtual space. By also tracking the movement of hands, the system allows user to interact with virtual objects (add, delete and move) within the space by gestures.

We built a software for virtual reality assisted design, run on personal computers. This software can also be extended for other uses like gaming. This system uses webcam to track uses head position and facing angle. Tools used for this head tracking part is mainly C++, and OpenCV. After getting use’s head movement, the screen display will update accordingly in real-time. We use unity for the 3D scene and display update. Another key feature of this system is allowing user to interact with virtual objects in the scene by gesture, like pick up, drop, and push. This is achieved by using leap motion controller sensor, and pattern recognition techniques.
